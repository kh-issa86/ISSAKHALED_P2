# Project 2 at OpenClassrooms - web developer: Turn a mockup into a website 
***

The objective is to integrate the model of a vacancy planning site named "Reservia" 
Elements provided by the virtual company.

    The mockup for computer and phone resolutions is given to us.
    All images on the site are also delivered in sm, md, l & xl format.
    The icons come from Font Awesome
    The colors are: blue # 0065FC - light blue #DEEBFF - gray # F2F2F2
    The font is "Raleway"

## Specifications

    -The integration must be done in HTML5 & CSS3, without framework (bootstrap for example)
    -The search field must be an input field, the text of which can be edited. However, 
    the search functionality should not be implemented.
    -Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable in its entirety. 
    For now the links will be empty.

    -In the menu, the “Accommodation” and “Activities” links are anchors that must lead
    to the sections of the page.
    -Even if no tablet resolution mockup is provided, the integration must support it.
    -The images must be of adequate size so that they are the prettiest possible while impacting 
    as little as possible the loading time of the page.
    -The code must use semantic tags and must not contain any errors or alerts to the
    W3C HTML and CSS validator.
    -The site must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
    -HTML and CSS should be separated and the folder should be organized
    -The code must be versioned with git and must have a remote repo on Github or Gitlab
